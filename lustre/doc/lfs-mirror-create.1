.SH NAME
lfs mirror create \- create a mirrored file or directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lfs mirror create
<\fB\-\-mirror\-count\fR|\fB\-N\fR[\fImirror_count\fR]>
.RI [ setstripe_options | \fB--parent ] ...
.RI < filename | directory >
.SH DESCRIPTION
This command creates a mirrored file or directory specified by the path name
\fIfilename\fR or \fIdirectory\fR.
.br
The \fB\-\-mirror\-count\fR|\fB\-N\fR option is required and indicates how many
mirrors that have the same layout will be created. It can be repeated multiple
times to separate mirrors that have different layouts. The \fImirror_count\fR
argument is optional and defaults to 1 if it's not specified; if specified, it
must follow the option without a space.
.br
The \fIsetstripe_options\fR specify the specific layout for the mirror. It can
be a plain layout with specific striping pattern or a composite layout like
Progressive File Layout (PFL) (see \fBlfs-setstripe\fR(1)).
If \fIsetstripe_options\fR are not specified,
then the stripe options inherited from the previous component will be used. If
there is no previous component or \fB\-\-parent\fR option is specified, then the
default stripe options inherited from parent directory will be used. For stripe
options, only \fIstripe_count\fR, \fIstripe_size\fR and OST \fIpool_name\fR can
be inherited.
.br
If no option is specified, then the command will return an error.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-\-mirror\-count\fR|\fB\-N\fR[\fImirror_count\fR]
The number of mirrors that have the same layout to be created. The option can be
repeated multiple times to separate mirrors that have different layouts. The
\fImirror_count\fR argument is optional and defaults to 1 if it's not specified;
if specified, it must follow the option without a space.
.TP
.I setstripe_options
The layout of one mirror. The options are the same as those for
\fBlfs-setstripe\fR(1) command.
If \fIsetstripe_options\fR are not specified, then
the stripe options inherited from the previous component will be used.
.TP
.B \-\-parent
This option indicates that the default stripe options inherited from parent
directory will be used.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B lfs mirror create -N2 /mnt/lustre/file1
Create a mirrored file with 2 mirrors. Each mirror has the same default striping
pattern inherited from parent directory or filesystem-wide default.
.TP
.B lfs mirror create -N2 -E 1M -E eof -c -1 /mnt/lustre/dir1
Create a mirrored directory with 2 PFL mirrors. Each mirror has the same
specified PFL layout.
.LP
.B lfs mirror create -N3 -E 1M -c 1 -E 32M -c 4 -S 16M -E eof -c -1
.B /mnt/lustre/file1
.in
Create a mirrored file with 3 PFL mirrors. Each mirror has the same specified
PFL layout.
.TP
.B lfs mirror create -N -c 1 -S 4M -N -c 2 -o 2,3 -N --parent /mnt/lustre/file1
Create a mirrored file with 3 plain layout mirrors. The first mirror has a
single stripe and 4MB stripe size. The second mirror has two stripes and locates
on OSTs with indices 2 and 3. It also has 4MB stripe size inherited from the
first mirror. The third mirror has default striping pattern inherited from
parent directory.
.LP
.B lfs mirror create -N2 -E 4M -c 2 --pool flash -E eof -c 4 -N3 -E 16M -c 4 -S
.B 16M --pool archive -E eof -c -1 /mnt/lustre/file1
.in
Create a mirrored file with 5 PFL mirrors. The first and second mirrors have the
same PFL layout, and both of the components are allocated from the \fBflash\fR
OST pool. The last three mirrors have the same PFL layout, and each of these
components have a stripe size of 16MB and use OSTs in the \fBarchive\fR pool.
